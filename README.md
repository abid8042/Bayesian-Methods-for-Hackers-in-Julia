* [**Chapter 1: Introduction to Bayesian Methods**](https://abid8042.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers-in-Julia/Ch1_Introduction_Julia.html)
    
    Introduction to the philosophy and practice of Bayesian methods and answering the question, "What is probabilistic programming?" Examples include:
    - Inferring human behaviour changes from text message rates

* [**Chapter 2: A little more on Turing**](https://abid8042.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers-in-Julia/Ch_2_More_Turing.html)
   
   We explore modeling Bayesian problems using Julia's Turing library through examples. How do we create Bayesian models? Examples include:
    - Detecting the frequency of cheating students, while avoiding liars
    - Calculating probabilities of the Challenger space-shuttle disaster

* [**Chapter 3: Opening the Black Box of MCMC**](https://abid8042.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers-in-Julia/Ch_3_MCMC.html)
   
   We discuss how MCMC operates and diagnostic tools. Examples include:
    - Bayesian clustering with mixture models
